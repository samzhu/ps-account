use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update a resource. Updating a resource with PUT means the resource will be completely replaced by the data in the request, so fields that are missing in the request will be set to NULL.

| `PATCH`
| Used to partially update a resource. Only the fields that are actually included in the request will be updated. Other fields on the resource will not be touched.

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
